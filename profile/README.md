# N.K.G. Blaue Funken von 1954 e.V.

The work of the Neusser Karnevalsgesellschaft Blaue Funken von 1954 e.V. is aimed at maintaining and promoting carnival customs in its home town of Neuss. The aim of the winter customs is to forget everyday life for a few hours and join the ranks of the Funken family with cheerfulness, fun and joy. The involvement of youth work and marginalized groups in social or community life is particularly important as part of their charitable activities. Their club colors are blue and white.
